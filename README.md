# 🎓 Tutoring Side Quests

This repository is an archive of my coursework, labs, and projects completed throughout my time as a **Computer Science student at Howard University**.  
It started as a small repo to store **Computer Organization (MIPS Assembly)** code that I shared while tutoring, but has since grown into a place where I’ve kept my solutions and submissions from other CS courses — like **Operating Systems**, **Software Engineering**, and more.

## 🧭 Purpose

This repo isn’t meant to be a step-by-step guide or tutorial — it’s simply a **collection of my past work**.  
It’s here for:
- Reference and record-keeping of assignments I’ve completed.
- Future students who want to **see examples** of how certain problems or projects were approached.
- Anyone curious about the kinds of programming tasks covered in Howard’s CS curriculum.

> ⚠️ **Note:** These are my personal solutions. They’re not guaranteed to be perfect or the only correct approach.  
> Please use them responsibly — **as a reference, not for submission.**

## 📂 Repository Structure

Each folder represents a course, organized by labs, projects, and other materials.  
Most files include code I personally wrote or modified during the semester.

## 💬 A Note

I made this public to **preserve my journey** and maybe help someone working through similar coursework.  
If you find any of it useful, that’s great — just remember: real learning happens when you **write your own code**, not from copying someone else’s.
